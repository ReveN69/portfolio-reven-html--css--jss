Creating a guided portfolio project with some personal tweaks on the original project.
List is down below.
Props to the YouTube channel called How to Become a Developer: https://www.youtube.com/@howtobecomeadeveloper 
The tutorial I have followed is this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldwlOzRvYOU 

Changes to the original project:

1. Added a very basic dark mode (toggle) with a possibility to go back to light mode.
2. Added a share button for my drawings (copies the direct link for the img)
3. Added a new section in addition to the original section (separating my drawings from coding projects)
4. Added a hover effect for some buttons (zoom)
5. Created a favicon with GIMP and implemented it.
6. Added some more details in the "alt" for my images to describe more accurately.
7. Changed some basic colors to fit the dark mode and the light mode (mostly greyish variations).
8. Replaced some logos for contacts such as Instagram, Steam and Github.
9. Added a normalize.css file for a more browser friendly experience.
