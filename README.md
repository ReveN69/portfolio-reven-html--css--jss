Creating a guided portfolio project with some personal tweaks on the original project.
Props to the YouTube channel called How to Become a Developer: https://www.youtube.com/@howtobecomeadeveloper 

1. Added a very basic dark mode (toggle) with a light mode
2. Added a share button for my drawings
3. Added a new section in addition to the original section (separating my drawings from coding projects)
4. Added a hover effect for some buttons
5. Created a favicon with GIMP and added it.
6. Added some more details in the "alt" for my images to describe more accurately.
7. Changed some basic colors to fit the dark mode and the light mode (mostly greyish variations)
8. Replaced some logos for contacts such as Instagram, Steam and Github.
